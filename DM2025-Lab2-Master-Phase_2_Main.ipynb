    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",

    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
